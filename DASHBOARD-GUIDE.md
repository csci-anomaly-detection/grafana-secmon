## 🛠️ Dashboard Usage Tips

### Getting Started
1. **Start with "Security Master Spreadsheet"** - unified view of all critical information
2. **Use "Alert Analysis - Deep Dive"** - for detailed investigations
3. **Check "Network Traffic Analysis"** - for network-specific issues

### Troubleshooting
- **"Legacy query" errors**: Dashboards still work, ignore the errors
- **No data showing**: Check time range and refresh rate
- **Slow loading**: Reduce time range or increase refresh interval
- **Query timeouts**: System is configured with 60-second timeouts

### Performance Optimization
- **Shorter time ranges** load faster (1 hour vs 6 hours)
- **Fewer concurrent users** - share screens when possible
- **Close unused browser tabs** - each dashboard uses resources
- **Apply filters** to reduce query load on the system

### Best Practices
- **Set appropriate time ranges** based on your analysis needs
- **Use filters** to focus on relevant data
- **Export data** from table views for reports
- **Bookmark specific views** with applied filters
- **Share dashboard URLs** with applied time ranges and filters

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Empty dashboards**: Check Promtail is running and collecting logs
- **Query errors**: System still works, errors can be ignored
- **Slow performance**: Reduce time ranges, check system resources
- **Missing data**: Verify Suricata is generating alerts

### Resource Monitoring
```bash
# Check container resources
docker stats

# Check logs
docker logs grafana-secmon
docker logs loki-secmon
docker logs promtail-secmon
```

### Configuration Files
